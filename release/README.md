# Release

## Still a work in progress for use with moOde.

This should describe the process by which release candidates are made from the
`develop` branch, tagged, tested, and then pushed to the `master` branch.

Then there would be steps where announcements are made in the forum, and
the floodgates open :-).

## Fully Automatic

Should we have something that automatically creates builds from the `develop`
environment - that way beta-test users can just grab the latest release?

## Manually

Need to review the steps below, and apply to our case:

Would be useful to create a 'deploy.sh' script, for repeatability.
