# MoOde Audio EARLY DRAFT development guidelines

Our guidelines and best practices for development and everything around it.

? when to use moOde and when to use MoOde ?


## Mantras
- We start developing when there is a clear scope.
- We work in small, feature-based iterations.
- We code to the best of our abilities, according to our
[coding standards](coding-standards/README.md).
- We version our files with [Git](git/README.md).
- We [release](release/README.md) our work to publish it to the world.

## Later?
- We strive for test-driven development.

## Maybe at some point?
- We use [Docker](docker/README.md) for parity and to be up and running in no time.
